## About Pair Programming

Actually, it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like- working with a fellow code enthusiast, be that a coworker, friend or fellow student.

## Goals

Improve technical communication- a valuable skill for interviews
Learn to express your points of confusion- important for team engineering, especially when specialties differ
Build confidence in your ability to contribute to a team
Become a more collaborative, communicative leader


## How to Make This Pair Thing Work

###Before you begin:
Outline a general plan- this could be whiteboarding or just discussing concepts. This is the chance to choose a general starting path and clear up potential misunderstanding of the project's goals.
###The dynamic:
  A useful dichotomy from the get go is establishing _fluid_ "driver" and "navigator" roles
  
  Driver: Types what the navigator is guiding. It's important to think about why the navigator is designing the
  code as he is. Driving shouldn't be a passive role, nor should it be reserved for the less experienced coder. 
  
  Navigator: Guides the driver on what to type. Can ask the driver for suggestions and should be explaining the 
  decisions as she makes them.
    
  Remember these roles are fluid- this isn't a permanent role for your coding session, rather a hat you're putting on
  for a few minutes, or maybe 20 seconds.

From the get go, it's important to note that your potential skill levels may differ in this particular exercise. That gap may be minimal or significant, but the process of successful pair programming is the same. The easiest way to avoid the pitfalls of pair programming is to understand that both people can and should contribute. Strive to commit 50% of the navigation. To get the most out of this dynamic, follow these guidelines:

__Junior Coder__

  Navigate: If you know what to do or maybe just have an idea, tell your partner! Take over navigating for awhile 
  and see where you can take the code. This will build your confidence if you are newer- your insights are 
  valuable.
  
  Ask: If you're confused about why the senior coder has suggested a certain path, get clarification before you 
  continue. This builds your ability to work well in a team.
  
__Senior Coder__

  Drive: Your partner may have some clever intuitions you hadn't considered. This also helps you become a more 
  collaborative leader.
  
  Explain: This is your opportunity to see if you really understand this algorithm/framework/etc... be your 
  favorite professor. It's also a chance to develop your technical communication skills.


##Why It's Amazing and You Should Try It

Pair programming forces you to take the abstract concepts flying from your brain to your fingers and convert those ideas into words. It sounds easy, but this can be an illuminating process for both of you. It can be easy to code even if your grasp on many concepts is tentative. When you find yourself at a loss for words that should be a red flag. Has your logic diverged with the code you've written? Maybe you're unclear on terminology which is necessary when working with a team of developers. You're also more likely to realize logic or syntax mistakes as you're writing your program, pick up new keyboard shortcuts and just generally gain a better understanding of the problem at hand.

Think of pair programming as real-time [rubber ducky debugging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), but with a helpful partner who can help point those out and probably help you solve them.
