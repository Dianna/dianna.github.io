###Getting up to speed  
Isomorphic JavaScript apps are rising rapidly in popularity bringing a slew of benefits to their creators when correctly implemented. So what is an "isomorphic" app anyways? This concept in itself is simple: An isomorphic app can run both client- and server-side, and is essential to understand in order to get the full benefits of many newer frameworks and their possible combinations (e.g. browserify with node.js and React, or meteor, or rendr which integrates with Backbone.js apps). To better understand the increasing reputation of these frameworks let's check out some of the benefits of being able to run javascript on both the server and the browser.  
  
###The benefits  
The core concept of an isomorphic app is that speed, interactivity and search engine visibility don't need to be mutually exclusive features. This is accomplished by sharing logic between the client and server. This logic can include (as depends on the app's needs) API interaction, model validation, routing, templating and formatting. Well executed apps can have quick load times, a slick user experience due to rapid client-side navigation and offline interactivity, strong search engine presence using pre-rendered server-side templates, and allow the developer to "write once, write everywhere" which is the key to maintainability and easier debugging.
