If you’re anything like the rest of us, chances are you’ve struggled with productivity at some point (or most points). Somehow, *something* always manages to come up to break your concentration—be that a meeting, facebook message, or those BBC updates you haven’t gotten around to silencing yet—or maybe you’re uncertain how to prioritize and you get paralyzed by choice. This can be immensely frustrating, especially for someone who takes pride in their work. Like you, I’ve struggled with these problems and that set me on my quest to find a solution that works for me. I’d like to share some of my findings with you and how they’ve made a difference in both my work and non-work life.

### Respect your time
This is really important. Being productive isn’t about putting in more hours, it’s about making real accomplishments. Yet many of us feel pressured to “work” late or “work” during lunch. I put work in quotes because we both know there’s a point where you’re not accomplishing much, you’re just grinding your gears. In a munitions factory study, researchers found that workers output relative to hours worked was non-linear. In fact, they found that after 48 hrs/wk output barely increased at all. [More on that here](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/12/working-hours). Even more distressing are statistics showing that people feel pressured to the point of [setting up auto emails](http://www.relentlesseconomics.com/2016/04/27/what-exactly-is-gained-by-competitive-overtime/) to make it look like they’re working at the wee hours of the morning. Why were you hired or why did you start your business? Surely it wasn’t to just be there looking like you’re working. You can be an invaluable asset to your company and have a life. Really.

### Clearly defining goals
Ok. This one may sound easy, but it’s a really important step. There’s a lot buzzing around in your mind&mdash;that laundry heap’s getting pretty big, plus you really should call your mom sometime and get in shape and finish that drawing and start fixing one of eight bugs you need to solve by Friday while also implementing that new feature. See what I mean? That’s a lot and it’s not uncommon to feel stretched thin by the variety and uncertainty associated with some of these tasks.

To get started we need to break down these goals into measurable pieces with clearly defined next steps. The first time you do this there will be a lot to write. Take 10-20 minutes to get all of these jotted down somewhere. Then examine what you’ve written. Chances are, some will be nebulous (i.e. get in shape. What does that mean to you?). Break these down into clearer goals or set them aside for future consideration. For example, “get in shape” may be more of a lifestyle change than a particular health goal (i.e. run 20 minutes every day as opposed to lose 10lbs). Each goal should have a quantifiable end product. Remember you can always come back to this list and adjust or add to it as needed, it’s not set in stone.

### Knock out the little things
There are some things that may be really quick to knock out. If it takes less than two minutes, go ahead and do it. Order your new mouse and take out the recycling. 

### Schedule next steps
Now that you have your tangible goals it’s time to do something with them. Set a due date for larger goals even if it doesn’t inherently have a due date. An example could be “Write next chapter” of that novel you’re working on. It may be unclear exactly how much time that should take, but you should be able to intuit a reasonable time to have it done by. Record that day and plan the days leading up to it with that goal in mind. It takes some practice to correctly estimate the amount of time a task will take to accomplish. Don’t let that discourage you, just adjust your estimates as necessary and remember that the next time you’re trying to schedule a deadline.

### Take breaks
The amount of breaks and their lengths depends a lot on the individual and the task at hand. When I really get in the zone while coding, sometimes taking no breaks for 3 hours makes sense. Other times my mind seems to wander incessantly and breaking down the work into palatable chunks makes more sense. When I’m in doubt, I go with the latter.

A good sized chunk of work time is around 25 minutes. I can definitely get something done in that period of time, but it’s short enough that I can make myself concentrate even if my brain is rebelling that day. After that chunk, I’ll take a 5 minute break. It’s just short enough that I get relief from the work without losing my train of thought. Make it a tea break, yoga break or a chance to message back your buds. I’ve found those short breaks often allow new thoughts to surface about my task at hand that I may have pushed back while trying to knock the work out, so the value for these breaks can go well beyond just resting your mind. Then get back to work.

You don’t want to do this for too long. About four 25-on 5-off cycles is a good maximum. After that, take a longer 25-40 minute break. Make sure it’s a real break since you’ll be back to it afterwards!

### Create a nice work environment
Your environment likely has a strong impact on your ability to concentrate. Control the pieces that you can or talk to your boss about small changes that can benefit everyone. Meetings are a classic interruption example. Making it a priority at your company to minimize meetings with clear start / end times and only having them at the very beginning or end of the day is a good way to give employees uninterrupted work time.

Something you can definitely control are updates you receive. Mute your phone, gchat, etc… while you’re in a 25 minute work session. Even if you don't check these updates, that ding can break your concentration.

### Start small
Nearing the end of a huge product release may not be the best time to cut back your caffeine consumption, lose 10 lbs, do your dishes daily and take your dog out 2 times a day to play. Take it easy on yourself and tackle your goals a little at a time. You scheduled your next steps earlier. Keep those as absolutes.

Every morning, set aside 10-15 minutes to schedule what you’ll accomplish that day. Give yourself a realistic amount of time to accomplish each task and make sure that the task is clearly defined. If it’s not, set aside time to define it or restrict your time allocated to explore it. Break each task into ~25 minute sessions (i.e. if you think it will take 1hr, that is roughly two 30 minute sessions with a 10 minute break in the middle, or three 20 minute sessions with 5 minute breaks in between). Don’t forget to schedule a couple of longer breaks after about every two hours of work. Write this plan out and stick to it religiously.

Try this for one week to see if it works. Try it for two to build the habit. Good luck!

### Ideas behind this plan
I wanted to take a moment to highlight some sources that helped me put together the above plan for myself. I drew heavily from David Allen’s [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) and the Francesco Cirillo’s [Pomodoro Method](http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique). [This Trello blog](http://blog.trello.com/slacking-off-speed-up-productivity?utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=Jan2017_Newsletter2&utm_medium=email) was also helpful.
