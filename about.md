I'm a fullstack software engineer currently brushing up my javascript skills at Hack Reactor in San Francisco. My recent projects inlude analyzing classroom data and visualizing the results using Dimple.js/D3 as well as a deep dive into AngularJS and Ionic with an interactive mobile conference app. In my off-computer life I love pushing my limits, last year completing a 2184 mile backpack trip on the Appalachian Trail. Eventually I hope to complete my triple crown (~5700 miles to go)!
