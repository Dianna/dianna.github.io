I am a front-end engineer with a strong JavaScript background looking for remote opportunities. 

I love working with a modern tech stack and have coded most extensively using AngularJS. Recently I've been getting back into React and using ES6. My experience also extends to back-end tech such as Node.js and MySQL. I’m open to learning other frameworks and languages, chances are if it’s a major JS framework, I’ve worked with it before.

I take long term implications when I code seriously and will always advocate for having a plan and adjusting it as necessary rather than flying blind—that means I can produce high quality code quickly. I thrive in environments where communication is open and autonomy is expected. When I tackle a problem I like to explore its source and a variety of solutions, running through potential side effects before touching the keyboard. I enjoy the whole scope of engineering from managing new feature development to digging into a gnarly bug.
