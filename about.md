I'm a fullstack software engineer currently with a strong JavaScript background. Most recently I worked with a four person engineering team creating a peer to peer energy sales platform integrated with smart meters to control and monitor energy use (We used React, Flux, Node.js with Express, MySQL with Bookshelf.js, socket.io and a hardware prototype).  
  
Some other projects inlude analyzing classroom data and visualizing the results using Dimple.js/D3 as well as a deep dive into AngularJS and Ionic with an interactive mobile conference app. I constantly push my limits by learning new frameworks and languages and striving for deeper understanding of the technology I use.  
  
In my off-computer life my three big loves are reading, cooking and backpacking. Last year I completed a 2184 mile backpack trip on the Appalachian Trail. Eventually I hope to complete my triple crown by hiking the PCT and CDT (~5700 miles to go)!
